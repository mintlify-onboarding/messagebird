## Initial setup

During the signup process, you provide us with the name of your company or business. In MessageBird, this is known as your Organization.

Weâ€™ll also ask you to provide the name of your team or department. We use this information to set up your first [Workspace](/applications/general/organization-settings/workspaces).

### Organization and workspace setup

Organizations and workspaces are designed to make it easy for you to set up and manage operations and communications across different departments within your company. 

Familiarize yourself with how organizations and workspaces work to effectively manage your operations and communications.

### Organizations

Organizations should be set up at the company or business level. Many users will only need to set up one organization, unless they have multiple companies or operate in multiple countries. Organizations contain workspaces.

### Workspaces

[Workspaces](/applications/general/organization-settings/workspaces) exist within an organization and should be set up at the team or department level. Depending on the size and complexity of your company, you may need to set up multiple workspaces.

Workspaces allow for focused collaboration and management of operations within specific teams or departments. Therefore, consider setting up separate workspaces for different teams or departments to facilitate efficient communication and collaboration.
